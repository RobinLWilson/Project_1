# Project_1

This is an analysis of top Spotify tracks in 2023.
We set out to analyze what users are listening to and discover trends and implications so streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple & Deezer) can increase potential revenue.
We used python, matplotlib, pandas, and stats.

This was a collaborative project between 4 data science students:
