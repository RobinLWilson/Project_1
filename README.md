# Project_1

This is an analysis of top Spotify tracks in 2023.
We set out to analyze what users are listening to and discover trends and implications so streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple & Deezer) can increase potential revenue.
We used python, matplotlib, pandas, and stats.

Our findings:
Question 1:

Question 2:


Question 3:
Question 3 looks at songs charted on Apple Music, Spotify, and Deezer in 2023. 



Question 4:
Question 4 looks at songs streamed in 2023 by their release year. 

We see that songs released in 2023 represent only 6% of streaming, songs released in 2022 represent 26% of streaming and songs released before 2022 represent 68% of streaming.  An Anova test and p-value told us there is a statistically significant difference between year groups.
